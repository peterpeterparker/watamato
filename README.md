## Getting Started

Once again I have to find a new place to live in Z√ºrich City and therefore once again I have to use search engines and platforms to browse flats, that were, at least to my eyes, never upgraded in terms of UX and even sometimes design, since the ‚Äô90s üôà.

Sunday morning, while I was about to visit such websites, I realize that there are no ways to me to undergo the frustration of using these for weeks or months, again üò§.

That's why I've created in a couple of days this prototype to help me solve my problem.

Btw. I'm still looking for a new apartment in town. If you have any tips or looking for someone to takeover your rent, ping me üôè.

## Features

A Trello look alike board automatically updated with incoming flat opportunities from the housing online market.

Currently there are no filter available. It's a personal projects and therefore they are applied at the source with my matching expectations.

But hey, it's open source, pull requests are welcome üòÅ.
